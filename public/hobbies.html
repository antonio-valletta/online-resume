        <h1>What about my hobbies?</h1> 

        <p>Well, in my free time i like to watch Formula 1 and how teams, mechanics and drivers manage to squeeze every single bit of 
        performance out of the car, i like to read and learn about different strategies based on the race track and the weather, 
        as well studying how the car is set up to go faster or to behave better in different turns and corners.</p>

        <p>I also enjoy playing video games, the ones that requires a lot of thinking, like puzzle or strategy games, or team-based 
        games where you have to play a specific role and help your teammates to reach a specific goal.</p>

        <p>Sometimes i like to take a couple of minutes for myself and think of a new project i could work on, something that
        could help me improve my programming skill and broaden my horizons.</p>

        <p>Last, but not least, i also enjoy reading books and playing chess.</p>
